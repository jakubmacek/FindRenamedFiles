A small tool that helps me synchronize large files to my portable hard drive.

Pull requests are welcome.

If the files are just moved or renamed in the source directory, common synchronization tools delete the file in the original target directory and copy the file again into the new target directory. This tool is intended to be run before this to move and/or rename such files beforehand to reduce the synchronization time.
